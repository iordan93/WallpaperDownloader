# WallpaperDownloader
A simple app for downloading wallpapers from http://wallpaperswide.com/

*The app currently supports the two most widely used browsers: Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.*

When the application starts, it asks the user which browser they would like to use. After that, it lets them select a category
and, optionally, a subcategory to download from. Finally, the app asks which pages it should download images from.

Whent the user has made all these choices, the app points the browser to the selected category (and subcategory) and
downloads all images in the selected pages to the ```Wallpapers``` directory.

**Note:** The application might take a while to run on a slower connection.
